# Panther Parking

[Heroku App](https://panther-parking.herokuapp.com)

Middlebury college students, faculty, and visitors are often at a loss when it comes to figuring out where they can and can't park. This is due in large part to the confusing collection of parking permits and rules that make it difficult to understand where there is parking available, and if a particular permit is allowed to park in that area.

Panther Parking is an interactive informational application that aims to provide insight into where students, faculty, and visitors are allowed to park on campus.

This project was originally developed by [@csci312-f19/parking](https://github.com/orgs/csci312-f19/teams/parking/members)
as part of the Software Development course (CSCI 312) at Middlebury College. 

# Project Skeleton Top-level

This repository combines the client and server into a single repository that can be co-developed, tested and ultimately deployed to Heroku or basin.cs.middlebury.edu.

The client was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (CRA) and the server is a separate Node.js application. The client-server integration is based on this [tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) and [repository](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo). This repository will be referred to as the "top-level" to distinguish it from the client and server.

## Installing (and Adding) Dependencies

The skeleton is structured as three separate packages. That is a "top-level" package and a separate "client" and "server". Thus initially installing dependencies is a 3 step process that runs "install" for each of the packages.

```
npm install
npm install --prefix client
npm install --prefix server
```

You can run all three of these steps in sequence form the root of the repository with:

```
npm run setup:local
```

The `--prefix` option treats the supplied path as the package root. In this case it is equivalent to `cd client` then `npm install` then `cd ..`.

**Windows Users**: There appears to be an [error](https://stackoverflow.com/q/50653324) using the `prefix` argument on Windows. Instead of using `prefix` you will need to manually change to the client and server directories before running `npm install` and possibly other `npm` commands.

**You will typically not need to install any dependencies in the top-level `package.json` file**. Doing so is a common mistake. Most dependencies are needed by the client or the server and should be installed in the respective sub-packages, e.g. to install `reactstrap` for your client application:

```
npm install --save reactstrap --prefix client
```

## Running the Application

In order to run the application, follow the instructions in the server README. It explains how to seed the database before starting the application with `npm start`. This launches the CRA development server on <http://localhost:3000> and the backend server on http://localhost:3001. By setting the `proxy` field in the client `package.json`, the client development server will proxy any unrecognized requests to the server. By default this starts the server in hot-reloading mode (like with the client application).

## Testing

The client application can be independently tested as described in the [CRA documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests), i.e.:

```
npm test --prefix client
```

The server can be similarly independently tested:

```
npm test --prefix server
```

## Linting

Both the client and server can be independently linted via:

```
npm run lint --prefix client
```

and

```
npm run lint --prefix server
```

## Continuous Integration

The skeleton is setup for CI with Travis-CI. Travis will build the client and test and lint both the client and the server.

## Deploying to Heroku

Your application can be deployed to [Heroku](heroku.com) using the approach demonstrated in this [repository](https://github.com/mars/heroku-cra-node).

Assuming that you have a Heroku account, have installed the [Heroku command line tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and committed any changes to the application, to deploy to Heroku:

1. Create the Heroku app, e.g.:

    ```
    heroku apps:create
    ```

1. Push to Heroku

    ```
    git push heroku master
    ```

Depending on how you implement your server, you will likely need create "add-ons" for your database, etc. and migrate then seed your database before you deploy.

### Heroku with RDBMS

Heroku provides a free add-on with the PostgreSQL database. Provision the add-on with the following command. The provisioning will define `process.env.DATABASE_URL` in the Heroku environment (which can be used by your database interface, e.g. by Knex in its configuration file).

```
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Once you have deployed your application (and provisioned the database) migrate and seed the database on Heroku with the following commands. `heroku run` executes the specified command in the context of your application on the Heroku servers.

```
heroku run 'cd server && npx knex migrate:latest'
heroku run 'cd server && npx knex seed:run'
```

You can test your backend without pushing to Heroku. The database Heroku created for you is accessible from anywhere. Use `heroku config` to obtain the `DATABASE_URL` variable. Define that variable locally with `?ssl=true` appended, e.g.

```
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://...?ssl=true"
```

then start your server locally in production mode, e.g. `NODE_ENV=production npm start --prefix server`.

You can also directly access your PostgreSQL database. Download and install one of the many PostgreSQL clients and use the `DATABASE_URL` from Heroku for the connection information.

### Heroku with MongoDB

Heroku has several MongoDB add-ons. Provision a free MongoDB add-on with:

```
heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox
```

Once you have deployed your application (and provisioned the database) seed the database on Heroku with `mongoimport`. You will need the `MONGODB_URI` from `heroku config`.

## Deploying to Basin

Your project can be deployed to basin.cs.middlebury.edu (where it is typically run within `screen` on an unused port). As with Heroku you will like need to create and seed your database before you deploy.

1. Build production assets for the client application (from the top-level directory):

    ```
    npm run heroku-postbuild
    ```

1. Start the server from the top-level directory (note you will need to pick a different, unused, port):

  	```
  	NODE_ENV=production PORT=5042 npm run start --prefix server
  	```

## How We Created the Skeleton

To ensure consistent style we use the CRA-recommended [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) package. We installed it in the "top-level" package with

```
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged prettier
```

and added the recommended configuration to automatically reformat code during the commit. That is whenever you commit your code, Prettier will automatically reformat your code during the commit process (as a "hook"). The hook is specified in the top-level `package.json` file. The client and server has its own ESLint configuration.

We added custom ESLint rules to capture common errors. To ensure compatibility with Prettier, we also installed the `eslint-config-prettier` package in both the client and server to disable styling rules that conflict with Prettier.

```
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier --prefix server
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier --prefix client
```

and added an `"extends"` entry to `.eslintrc.json`.

To enable Heroku deployment we added the following to the top-level `package.json` file:

* Specify the node version in the `engines` field
* Add a `heroku-postbuild` script field that will install dependencies for the client and server and create the production build of the client application.
* Specify that `node_modules` should be cached to optimize build time

In addition a `Procfile` was added in the top-level package to start the server.
